## About Me:
I am a beginner frontend developer. I have certain knowledge, but I want to expand and deepen it, so I continue to learn. I am inspired by the possibility that the code I can write can be useful and work anywhere and for anyone. In fact, writing code is creativity. The Web is an extremely creative environment, an opportunity for everyone to improve themselves, including me.

Before I got into Frontend Development, I devoted most of my life to music. I graduated from the Donetsk State Conservatory. S.S. Prokofiev, after graduation I worked in many professional symphony and chamber orchestras.
